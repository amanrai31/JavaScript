# CONTENT => String

## String 
String is Sequence of charaters, used for stroing text. We can use single/double quotes/templete(backticks)

Backslash escape charater( \ )- truns special character into string charater.
- \' means single qoute
- \"  means double qoute
- \\ means backslash

```
let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
```

**NOTE :** JS strings are primitive values, created from literals, but string also can be defined as objects using new keyword. But string obj can produce unexpected results, so *use string litterals*.
